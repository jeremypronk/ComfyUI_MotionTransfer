## 🎉 NEW in v0.8 - Quality Improvement Workflows

**Recommended:** Start with these to get the best quality output!

### 📁 `workflow_pipeline_a_quality_v08.json` ⭐ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

**Pipeline A with v0.8 Quality Improvements**

**What's new:**
- ✨ **Raised cosine tile blending** - Eliminates visible seams completely
- ✨ **Color matching in tile overlaps** - Fixes exposure discontinuities
- ✨ **Joint bilateral flow upsampling** - Prevents edge bleeding, preserves sharp boundaries
- ✨ **Canny edge detection** - Explicit edge constraints for flow
- ✨ **Adaptive temporal blending** - Motion-aware, confidence-weighted stabilization
- ✨ **Scene cut detection** - Prevents blending across shot changes

**Quality improvements you'll notice:**
- No more visible seams at tile boundaries
- Sharper edges around objects (no halos)
- Smoother motion without ghosting
- Better handling of fast motion
- Cleaner transitions across scene cuts

**Use this for:** Production work, best quality output

---

### 📁 `workflow_bidirectional_flow.json`

**Advanced: Bidirectional Flow with Occlusion Detection**

**What it does:**
- Uses new `BidirectionalFlowExtractor` node (v0.8)
- Computes forward AND backward flow
- Checks forward-backward consistency
- Detects occluded regions explicitly
- Produces physics-based confidence maps (much better than heuristic)

**Best for:**
- Scenes with faces (eyes, mouth occlusions)
- Hand motion (finger occlusions)
- Overlapping objects
- Complex organic motion
- Any scene where standard confidence is unreliable

**Processing time:** ~2x single-direction flow (runs flow twice)
**Quality gain:** Significantly better confidence → less flicker in uncertain regions

---

### 📁 `workflow_quality_comparison.json`

**Side-by-Side: v0.7 Legacy vs v0.8 Quality**

**What it does:**
- Processes same input with BOTH settings
- Creates two output sequences for A/B testing
- Legacy branch uses v0.7 settings (linear blending, guided filter, fixed temporal)
- Quality branch uses v0.8 settings (all improvements enabled)

**Use this to:**
- See exactly what each improvement does
- Convince yourself the quality gains are worth it
- Understand the difference between modes
- Inspect tile seams, edge halos, temporal artifacts side-by-side

**Expected differences:**
- **Tile seams:** Legacy shows gradients on uniform surfaces, v0.8 seamless
- **Edge halos:** Legacy shows bleeding around objects, v0.8 clean
- **Temporal flicker:** Legacy flickers on slow motion, v0.8 smooth
- **Ghosting:** Legacy shows double images in fast motion, v0.8 clean

---

## Quick Start

1. **Open ComfyUI**
2. **Load a workflow:** Drag and drop one of the JSON files into ComfyUI
3. **Configure inputs:**
   - Replace `your_video.mp4` with your actual video file
   - Replace `your_still_16k.png` with your high-res still image
4. **Queue the workflow**

### 📁 `workflow_pipeline_b2_cotracker.json` ✨ NEW

**Pipeline B2: CoTracker Mesh-Warp (Advanced - Temporal Stability)**

**What it does:**

- Builds deformation mesh from point trajectories using Delaunay triangulation
- Warps still image using barycentric interpolation (same as Pipeline B)
- Transformer-based tracking sees entire video for temporal stability
- Handles occlusions and complex organic motion

**Best for:**
- Temporal stability (reduces flicker vs frame-by-frame flow)
- Organic motion (character faces, hands, fabric)
- Large deformations with occlusions
- Videos where points appear/disappear
- When Pipeline B has temporal jitter

**Nodes used:**
```
LoadVideo → GetVideoComponents → GridPointGeneratorNode
                                        ↓
                                  CoTrackerNode (external)
                                        ↓
                                 MeshFromCoTracker (new)

                                   HiResWriter
```

**Settings:**
- `grid_size`: 64 (4096 points for 64x64 grid)
- `max_num_of_points`: 4096 (can go lower for speed)
- `confidence_threshold`: 0.90 (filter unreliable tracks)
- `min_distance`: 30 (minimum spacing between points)
- `min_triangle_area`: 100.0 (same as Pipeline B)
- `interpolation`: linear (recommended for mesh)

**Requirements:**
- **External dependency:** CoTracker node must be installed
  ```bash
  cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
  git clone https://github.com/s9roll7/comfyui_cotracker_node.git
  ```
- **Model download:** CoTracker3 (~500MB) auto-downloads from torch.hub on first use
- **VRAM:** 8-12GB (lower than Pipeline B thanks to sparse tracking)

**Performance:**
- ~10-15 seconds per frame (16K output)
- Slower than Pipeline A, similar to Pipeline B

| Temporal stability | Good | **Excellent** |
| Occlusion handling | Limited | **Excellent** |
| Speed | Fast | Medium |
| VRAM | 12-24GB | 8-12GB |

**What it does:**
- Extracts optical flow from video
- Estimates depth maps for each frame
- Reprojects still image using depth + flow
- Handles parallax by treating scene as 3D proxy
- Exports final frames

**Best for:**

                                      HiResWriter
```

**Settings:**
- `model`: midas (currently placeholder)
- `focal_length`: 1000 (adjust for your camera)

**Current Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Uses placeholder depth estimation (simple Gaussian blur)

## Configuration Guide

### Input Files

**Video Requirements:**
- Resolution: 720p-1080p (low-res driving video)
- Frame rate: 16-30 fps
- Duration: 3-10 seconds typical
- Format: MP4, MOV, AVI (anything ffmpeg supports)
- Location: Place in `ComfyUI/input/` folder

**Still Image Requirements:**
- Resolution: Any high-res (4K, 8K, 16K+)
- Format: PNG, EXR, TIFF, JPG
- Color: sRGB (standard)
- Location: Place in `ComfyUI/input/` folder

### Output Settings

**Default output path:** `output/pipeline_X/frame_XXXX.png`

**Change output format:**
```json
"widgets_values": [
  "output/my_project/frame",  // Path (without extension)
  "png",                       // Format: png/exr/jpg
  0                           // Starting frame number
]
```

**Format comparison:**
- **PNG:** 8-bit sRGB, lossless, ~10-50 MB per 16K frame
- **EXR:** 16-bit half, linear, ~100-200 MB per 16K frame (best for VFX)
- **JPG:** 8-bit sRGB, quality 95, ~5-20 MB per 16K frame (smallest)

### Memory Optimization

**For 12GB VRAM:**
```json
// In TileWarp16K node:
"widgets_values": [
  1024,    // tile_size (reduced from 2048)
  64,      // overlap (reduced from 128)
  "cubic"
]
```

**For 8GB VRAM:**
```json
"widgets_values": [
  512,     // tile_size
  32,      // overlap
  "linear" // faster interpolation
]
```

**For 48GB+ VRAM:**
```json
"widgets_values": [
  4096,    // tile_size (larger tiles)
  256,     // overlap (better quality)
  "lanczos4"
]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "RAFT not found" error
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT.git
```

### Out of memory (CUDA OOM)
- Reduce `tile_size` in TileWarp16K
- Reduce `raft_iters` in RAFTFlowExtractor (try 8 instead of 12)
- Process fewer frames at once

### Visible seams in output
- Increase `overlap` parameter (try 256)
- Use `cubic` or `lanczos4` interpolation
- Check that guide_image is connected in Pipeline A

### Temporal flicker
- Increase `blend_strength` in TemporalConsistency (try 0.5)
- Use more RAFT iterations for better flow accuracy
- Check flow confidence maps for low-confidence regions

### Slow processing
- Reduce `tile_size` (faster but uses more tiles)
- Use `linear` interpolation instead of `cubic`
- Reduce `raft_iters` to 8
- Use Pipeline A instead of B or C

## Workflow Customization

### Combining with other ComfyUI nodes

**Add upscaling before motion transfer:**
```
LoadImage → Upscaler → (use as still_image)
```

**Add preview/downscale after:**
```
HiResWriter → ImageScale → SaveImage (for preview)
```

**Add masking:**
```
LoadImage (mask) → (future: mask support in nodes)
```

### Batch processing multiple videos

Create a loop wrapper or use ComfyUI's batch features to process multiple videos sequentially.

## Performance Benchmarks

**Hardware:** RTX 4090, 24GB VRAM
**Input:** 1080p video (5 sec @ 24fps = 120 frames) → 16K still

| Pipeline | Time per frame | Total time | VRAM | Notes |
|----------|---------------|------------|------|-------|
| A (Flow) | ~7 seconds    | ~14 min    | 12-24GB | Recommended |
| B (Mesh) | ~12 seconds   | ~24 min    | 12-24GB | Better for deformation |
| B2 (CoTracker) | ~10 seconds | ~20 min | 8-12GB | Best temporal stability |
| C (Proxy)| ~8 seconds    | ~16 min    | 12GB | Experimental |

**Settings used:** tile_size=2048, overlap=128, raft_iters=12 (A/B), grid_size=64 (B2)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try Pipeline A first** - It's the fastest and most reliable
2. **Experiment with parameters** - Adjust tile_size, overlap, blend_strength
3. **Test different videos** - Natural motion works best
4. **Compare outputs** - Try different pipelines on same input
5. **Report issues** - https://github.com/yourname/ComfyUI_MotionTransfer/issues
